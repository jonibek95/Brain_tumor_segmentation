# Brain Tumor Necrosis Segmentation (Whole-Slide Images)

This project focuses on **automatic segmentation of tumor necrosis** regions from **gigapixel Whole-Slide Images (WSI)** in brain histopathology.  
The model is based on **EfficientNet-B4 + UNet++**, optimized for high-resolution patch-based inference.

## üî¨ Background

**Necrosis** in brain tumors is a key indicator of:
- Tumor grade
- Aggressiveness
- Treatment prognosis

However, **WSI files are extremely high resolution (up to 80,000 √ó 80,000 px)**, requiring a specialized pipeline for:
- Gigapixel **downscaling**
- **Patch extraction**
- Segmentation and reconstruction back to WSI space

## üß† Project Pipeline

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation | Whole-Slide Images & pathology annotations were collected |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Downscaling | WSI resolution reduced for patch grid extraction |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Patch Extraction | Extracted image & mask patches from annotated regions |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model | EfficientNet-B4 UNet++ trained on extracted patches |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ Inference | Model predicts necrosis per patch |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ Reconstruction | Patch predictions merged back into WSI mask |
